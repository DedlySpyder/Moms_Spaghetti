Pre-0.0.1 stuff
- Docs/commenting

- can't partially select an entity, just expand to include the whole thing? now or later?


Future stuff
- on script built, if it's not overlapping something else then I'll need to count it
- Ghost timeout? it's a week in game, so irrelevant I guess?
- on_player_mined_entity - triggers on mining ore, I can filter that out with event filters
- mod compat - waterfill?
- mod compat - need to test the dynamic selection of layers with a dummy mod
- force unloading train station to allowed tiles?
- feature - surface support - count/claim by surface
- feature - unclaim chunks
- feature - force support
- "feature" - actual sprites,icons?
            - add border to mineable tiles? (can I layer something on the border?)
- feature - color claimable count (1 = yellow, 0 or less = red)
- feature - mostly debug - show values for each chunk when clicking on the counter?
- change out allow shortcut for a top left button near the label -> shortcuts are just annoying to work with
- tests
